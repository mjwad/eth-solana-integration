# Ethereum-Solana Integration Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application designed to facilitate the integration of Ethereum and Solana blockchain networks. The project aims to enhance interoperability between the two ecosystems, enabling seamless cross-chain transactions and interactions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application in action.

## Project Structure

- The main page can be edited by modifying pages/index.js. The page will auto-update as you make changes.
- API routes are available at http://localhost:3000/api/hello and can be edited in pages/api/hello.js. The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*, allowing you to create serverless functions.

## Features
- Cross-Chain Transactions: Facilitate seamless transfers of assets and data between Ethereum and Solana.
- Interoperable Smart Contracts: Develop smart contracts that can operate on both blockchain networks.
- Unified Development Tools: Access libraries and APIs that streamline development for both ecosystems.
